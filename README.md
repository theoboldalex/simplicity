# On Simplicity

## Workflow
[Unix as an IDE](https://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/series/unix-as-ide/)
[Seven Habits of Effective Text Editing](https://moolenaar.net/habits.html)

## Tools
[Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
[NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)


## Philosophy
[Your problem with Vim is that you don't grok Vi](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218390/what-is-your-most-productive-shortcut-with-vim/1220118#1220118)

[This article](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/a-cautionary-tale-of-learning-to-code-my-own-eddb24d9d5a7) is about learning to code to get a job but it had a major impact on the way I approach my work when I first read it some years ago.
tl;dr - focus on a small set of tools and really learn how to use them
